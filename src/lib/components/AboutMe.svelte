		Hello! I'm Tarek, a passionate web developer with a strong interest in 3D graphics and
		interactive web technologies. I specialize in building engaging user experiences using modern
		JavaScript frameworks like Svelte, React, and libraries such as Three.js.
		<br />
		<br />
		Outside of coding, I love exploring new places, playing video games, and diving deep into various
		creative hobbies. I'm constantly looking for opportunities to learn and grow both professionally
		and personally.
