					Hello! I'm Tarek, a Computer Science student at Carleton University! I am pursuing a minor
					in mathematics and a concentration in AI & ML. I am fascinated by machine learning,
					specifically deep learning and its applications and also enjoy learning about various
					mathematical and statistical models. Feel free to explore what I'm currently working on
					(or have previously worked on) in the projects section, or on my GitHub!
					<br />
					<br />
					Outside of learning I enjoy spending time lifting weights and rock climbing, or relaxing at
					home while watching a movie or playing my favourite video game!
