			Hello! I'm Tarek, a Computer Science student at Carleton University! I am pursuing a minor in
			mathematics and a concentration in AI & ML. I am fascinated by machine learning, specifically
			deep learning and its applications and also enjoy learning about various mathematical and
			statistical models. Feel free to explore what I'm currently working on (or have previously
			worked on) in the projects section, or on my GitHub!
			<br />
			<br />
			Outside of learning I enjoy spending time lifting weights and rock climbing, or relaxing at home
			while watching a movie or playing my favourite video game!
