					Hi! I'm Tarek, a Computer Science student at Carleton University, with a minor in
					mathematics and a concentration in AI & ML. I have a deep fascination with machine
					learning, particularly deep learning and its practical applications. I'm also passionate
					about exploring the mathematical and statistical models that underpin these technologies.
					<br />
					<br />
					On quieter days, you’ll find me relaxing at home, watching a good movie, or diving into my
					favorite video game.
					<br />
					<br />
					Feel free to check out my current and past projects in the projects section or on my GitHub—I’d
					love to share what I’ve been working on! When I’m not immersed in learning or coding, I enjoy
					staying active through weightlifting and rock climbing.
